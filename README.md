# GA_FlappyBird

This program contains a neuroevolutionary algorithm to be able to solve a self made FlappyBird example.
This is a part of a bigger project were I'm writing a small paper. 

## Installation

I'll make this as short as possible....To be able to run the main.py file you'll need:
-- pygame
-- numpy

And that should be about it.

## Usage

If you are intressted in more details just hit me up via my E-Mail Adress: till.a.wollenmann@gmail.com

To start the program just run "python main.py" in the project directory.
